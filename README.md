# Election Analysis

## Overview of Project 
In this project, we analyzed a CSV file which contains a dataset of ballot IDs, name for the county and a name for the candidate for the Colorado Board of Elections. Our goal is to determine how many candidates and counties exist in this large dataset (approx. 370,000 rows!) and to determine which candidate received the most votes and was the winner of the election. We will need to examine and complete the steps below before we can get to our ultimate goal:

- Total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate received
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
